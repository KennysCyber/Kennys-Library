SocGholish Malware

SocGholish malware is a social engineering-based malware campaign that's been around since April 2018, tricking users through "drive-by downloads" disguised as legitimate software updates. The "soc" in SocGholish stands for social engineering, where a user unknowingly visits a compromised website and unintentionally downloads code. This malware often poses as updates for popular programs like Microsoft Teams, Chrome, or Firefox, typically arriving as ZIP files that need user interaction to be activated. Once executed, the malicious JavaScript within the download leverages "living-off-the-land binaries" (LOLBins) to pull in additional malicious payloads. This establishes command-and-control (C2) and allows the attackers to plant more harmful malware, including ransomware like LockBit, into the targeted organization. SocGholish primarily serves as an initial entry point, creating a foothold for further attacks.
