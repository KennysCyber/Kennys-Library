ALPHV / BlackCat

The BlackCat, also known as ALPHV, ransomware group is a big player in cybercrime today, running a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation that rents their ransomware tools to others. They first started around September 2021 and quickly became known for attacks like one in Sept 2022, where they targeted Italy’s GES energy, stealing 700GB of data and threatening to leak it. By Sept 2023, they hit MGM Resorts in a ten-minute social engineering attack and even claimed to breach Amazon’s Ring earlier that year. Their main tool, BlackCat ransomware, is one of the first to be written in Rust, which makes it harder to detect and enables cross-platform attacks on Windows and Linux. Since mid-December 2023, healthcare has been one of their most frequent targets among nearly 70 leaked victims.
