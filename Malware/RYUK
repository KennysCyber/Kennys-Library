Ryuk Malware
Ryuk is a dangerous type of ransomware that first showed up in August 2018, and it’s known for targeting big organizations like hospitals, newspapers, and city governments. Once it’s in a system, usually through phishing emails with malicious Word documents, it sets off a chain reaction. The Word doc runs a PowerShell script, which downloads the Emotet trojan, and then Emotet pulls down TrickBot, a spyware that collects administrator credentials. With those credentials, Ryuk moves through the network, targeting systems with private IP ranges like 10.x, 172.16.x, and 192.168.x. It encrypts files, starting with network drives, and even deletes shadow copies to stop users from restoring their systems through Windows System Restore. Ryuk doesn’t hit the host machine until it’s encrypted everything else. It’s based on an older ransomware called Hermes 2.1 and is used by a hacker group called WIZARD SPIDER. Since it started, Ryuk has made over 705 Bitcoin (worth about $3.7 million), making it one of the more successful ransomware campaigns out there.
