~Powershell File Hasher~ #creation-10/2024 

  #Created to be a desktop icon you can drag and drop files onto and will output assocaited hashes for checking.

1) Create a PS1 file with below script.
  # PowerShell Script to Calculate SHA256 and MD5 Hashes of a File Using Drag-and-Drop
  
  # Check if a file path is passed as an argument
  if ($args.Count -eq 0) {
      Write-Host "No file provided. Please drag and drop a file onto this script."
      exit
  }
  
  # Assign the file path from arguments
  $filePath = $args[0]
  
  # Check if the file exists
  if (Test-Path $filePath) {
      # Calculate SHA256 hash
      $sha256 = Get-FileHash -Path $filePath -Algorithm SHA256
      Write-Host "SHA256 Hash: $($sha256.Hash)"
  
      # Calculate MD5 hash
      $md5 = Get-FileHash -Path $filePath -Algorithm MD5
      Write-Host "MD5 Hash: $($md5.Hash)"
  } else {
      Write-Host "File not found. Please check the file path and try again."
  }

  # Keep the window open to view the result
  Read-Host -Prompt "Press Enter to exit"

2) Create a shortcut on Desktop

3) #Desktop shortcut (add below as Target field in properties) Include correct path to ps1 file saved.
  C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <C:\Users\..\Hasher.ps1>

4) # In properties of shortcut add this location to "Start In" field.
  C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0

5) Test by dragging and dropping file onto shortcut.
