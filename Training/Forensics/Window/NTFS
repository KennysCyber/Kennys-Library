Master File Table
Like the File Allocation Table, there is a Master File Table in NTFS. However, the Master File Table, or MFT, is much more extensive than the File Allocation Table. It is a structured database that tracks the objects stored in a volume. Therefore, we can say that the NTFS file system data is organized in the Master File Table. From a forensics point of view, the following are some of the critical files in the MFT:

$MFT
The $MFT is the first record in the volume. The Volume Boot Record (VBR) points to the cluster where it is located. $MFT stores information about the clusters where all other objects present on the volume are located. This file contains a directory of all the files present on the volume.

$LOGFILE
The $LOGFILE stores the transactional logging of the file system. It helps maintain the integrity of the file system in the event of a crash.

$UsnJrnl
It stands for the Update Sequence Number (USN) Journal. It is present in the $Extend record. It contains information about all the files that were changed in the file system and the reason for the change. It is also called the change journal.
