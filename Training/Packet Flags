Great read- https://www.firewall.cx/networking/network-protocols/tcp-udp-protocol/tcp-flag-options.html

1-Urg Pointer - Flag to repersent urgency 
2-ACK - Acknoledgemnt from host
3-Push - Used to set urgency on data but also unsure data is not stuck in memory bufffer for applications.
4-RST - used to reset a connection or tell that that service is not there on a port.
5-SYN - used to iniciate a conneciton.
6-FIN - Finsihes out a conneciton


Scanning techinques:
-SYN Scan
Packet Flags: SYN
Description: Often called a "half-open" scan, as the scanner sends a SYN packet to a target port and awaits a response but doesn’t complete the TCP handshake.

-Full Connect Scan
Packet Flags: SYN, ACK
Description: Completes the three-way handshake by sending SYN and expecting SYN/ACK, followed by an ACK to establish a full connection before closing it.

-NULL Scan
Packet Flags: None (No flags set)
Description: Sends a packet with no TCP flags set, which is unusual and may prompt specific responses from open and closed ports.

-FIN Scan
Packet Flags: FIN
Description: Sends packets with only the FIN flag, which can sometimes bypass firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS).

-Xmas Scan
Packet Flags: FIN, URG, PSH
Description: All these flags set create a "lit-up" packet, resembling a Christmas tree, often used to identify open ports based on response behavior.

-ACK Scan
Packet Flags: ACK
Description: Typically used to map out firewall rules, as it doesn’t establish a connection and instead checks if ports are filtered.

-Window Scan
Packet Flags: ACK
Description: Similar to an ACK scan but checks the TCP Window size returned by the target, which may reveal open or closed ports based on differences in the window size.

-Maimon Scan
Packet Flags: FIN, ACK
Description: Combines FIN and ACK, relying on how systems respond to determine whether ports are open or closed.

-UDP Scan
Packet Type: UDP (no flags)
Description: Sends UDP packets to probe open UDP ports. Detecting UDP scans may rely on ICMP "port unreachable" messages from closed ports.

Wireshark filters 4 Technique:

TCP SYN scan (nmap -sS <target>)
tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0 and tcp.window_size<=1024

TCP Connect() scan (nmap -sT <target>)
tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0 and tcp.window_size>1024

TCP Null scan (nmap -sN <target>)
tcp.flags==0

TCP FIN scan (nmap -sF <target>)
tcp.flags==0x001

TCP Xmass scan (nmap -sX <target>)
tcp.flags.fin==1 && tcp.flags.push==1 && tcp.flags.urg==1

UDP port scan (nmap -sU <target>)
icmp.type==3 and icmp.code==3
